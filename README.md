# Moment 5 (Part 2) - Create a web application that utilizes Fetch API
This is a web application that I've developed. It uses the web service in Part 1 and it lets you create, read, update and delete courses from a database via the website.
These courses are courses I've completed in my education.

The web service can be found from this link: http://samuelwarduppgifter.one/rest/index.html
